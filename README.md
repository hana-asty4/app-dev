# My Favorite Movie/Series
**The Queen's Corgi** is my favorite movie as of now because I could relate to it. Its lesson shows that even your best of friend can betray you just to get what he or she desires the most.

I don't really watch series but one series that I really loved was **Wednesday**. Its main message is  the concept of *"normal"* and how alienation in society can be the result of many different personalities and backgrounds clashing.
